# React Native: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')'. This typically occurs when attempting to access a property of an object that is either undefined or null before it's been properly assigned a value, often within asynchronous operations or before the component has finished rendering.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  This component attempts to access data from an API before it has been fetched and assigned to the state.

## The Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates several approaches to mitigate the error:

1. **Conditional Rendering:** Only render the elements that depend on the data once it has been fetched.
2. **Optional Chaining:** Use the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to safely access properties without causing an error if the object or property is nullish.
3. **Default Values:**  Provide default values for state variables to prevent undefined errors.

This example highlights best practices for handling asynchronous operations and preventing common errors in React Native development.  Always ensure your data is available before attempting to access its properties.
